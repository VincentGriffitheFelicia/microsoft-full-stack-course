I created a complete CRUD user management API with 4 new files:

User Model - Defines user properties (Id, FirstName, LastName, Email, PhoneNumber, CreatedAt, UpdatedAt)

UserService - In-memory service handling all CRUD operations with auto-incrementing IDs

UsersController - REST API with 5 endpoints:

GET all users
GET user by ID
POST create user
PUT update user
DELETE user
Program.cs - Configured dependency injection, added controllers, Swagger documentation, and CORS support

The API uses in-memory storage, returns proper HTTP status codes, includes error handling, and is ready to run with Swagger UI at /swagger for testing.
